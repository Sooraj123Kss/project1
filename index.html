        <p>Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, music, and even videos, based on patterns it has learned from large datasets. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes and categorizes information, generative AI goes a step further by producing original, human-like outputs. It relies on advanced models like neural networks and deep learning techniques to generate creative and contextually relevant responses. Applications of generative AI are vast, ranging from chatbots and virtual assistants to automated design and content creation. This technology is revolutionizing industries by enabling machines to assist with tasks that require imagination and innovation.</p>

                    <p>Additional details about the history of AI, including key figures, innovations, and the impact on various industries. The history of artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to the mid-20th century, when pioneers like Alan Turing laid the theoretical groundwork for machine intelligence. Turing's concept of a "universal machine" and his famous Turing Test set the stage for AI development. In 1956, John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the official birth of AI as a field of study.
Throughout the decades, AI has evolved through key milestones. The 1950s and 1960s saw early AI programs focused on problem-solving and symbolic reasoning. The 1980s introduced expert systems, which allowed computers to mimic human decision-making. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, demonstrating AI’s growing capabilities. The 2010s ushered in deep learning and neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in natural language processing, autonomous systems, and generative AI.</p>
