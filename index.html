        <h2 style="color: #e67e22;">AI in General</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It is broadly categorized into narrow AI, which is specialized for specific tasks like speech recognition and recommendation systems, and general AI, which remains theoretical and would possess human-like reasoning across multiple domains. AI incorporates technologies such as machine learning, allowing systems to learn from data and improve performance, deep learning, which mimics human neural networks, natural language processing (NLP) for understanding and generating language, and computer vision for analyzing visual information. AI has widespread applications across industries, including healthcare (diagnostics and robotic surgeries), finance (fraud detection and automation), retail (personalized recommendations), transportation (self-driving cars), and education (intelligent tutoring systems). As AI continues to evolve, advancements in ethical AI, automation, and human-AI collaboration are expected to shape the future, enhancing productivity and transforming everyday experiences in unprecedented ways.</p>

                    <p>Additional details about the history of AI, including key figures, innovations, and the impact on various industries. The history of artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to the mid-20th century, when pioneers like Alan Turing laid the theoretical groundwork for machine intelligence. Turing's concept of a "universal machine" and his famous Turing Test set the stage for AI development. In 1956, John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the official birth of AI as a field of study.
Throughout the decades, AI has evolved through key milestones. The 1950s and 1960s saw early AI programs focused on problem-solving and symbolic reasoning. The 1980s introduced expert systems, which allowed computers to mimic human decision-making. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, demonstrating AI’s growing capabilities. The 2010s ushered in deep learning and neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in natural language processing, autonomous systems, and generative AI.</p>
